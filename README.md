# Warning

This library is heavy **Work In Progress**. Once finished it can easily be used for face recognition with the OpenCV2 C++ API. The library will be a header-only library, so using it as simple as adding it to your include path. If you want to try this library, clone the repository and compile the src/main.cpp (you probably want to disable the tests in the CMakeLists.txt if you are using CMake).


No bug reports in these early development stages please. Expect major interfaces changes coming.
